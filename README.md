## 🎮 Premise

Meet **Steve** – your average, everyday guy who took the wrong job offer. Now he’s the guinea pig in an illegal time manipulation experiment run by the secretive **Chrono Syndicate**. Navigate the Syndicate’s labyrinthine facility, survive waves of robotic enforcers, and uncover the sinister purpose behind their experiments. All with a smirk, a shrug, and some seriously questionable life choices.

## 🌍 Setting

Chrono Tinker unfolds in a retro-futuristic laboratory complex riddled with:

- 🪑 Endless arrangements of reused tables as obstacles — no spikes, no lasers, just... tables  
- 🕹️ Button puzzles hidden in cluttered room layouts that Steve has to solve to progress  
- 🤖 Low-budget robots that chase Steve like overexcited Roombas  
- 🌫️ Bland hallways and recycled assets, sold as "experimental chambers" by the Syndicate  
- 🧥 Hooded figures appear every 5 levels with mysterious upgrade offers  
- 💬 Constant, sarcastic back-and-forth between Steve and the Chrono Syndicate via floating chat boxes
